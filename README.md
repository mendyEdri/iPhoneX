# iPhoneX

Following today's guild, 
here is the git repo


What we covered:

**1. Introducing to Safe Area - the problem on iPhone x without safe area, and how safe area can solve it**

## Enable safe area in XIB/Storyboard

2. Subview safe area - a guide to help us keep elements on subviews be on subview and keep margin from safe area.

3. We discover how to support iOS 10 with creating another top constraint with the margin we want and have, and set the relation to equal-or-bigger, and the safe area constraint with a priority of 750.

4. We saw how to have an elegant solution for the bottom view (it can be top as well), increasing the size of the view on iPhone X, with constraint only - we create constraint from top of the view to safe area bottom instead of changing the size of the view programmatically. 

5. We saw some code, to have the same solutions we had in constraint - to use programmatically when we creating or manipulating a view programmatically.



Thanks for participating, let me know if you have any comments.
